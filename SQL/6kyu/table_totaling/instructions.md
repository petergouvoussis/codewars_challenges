For this challenge you need to create a simple query to display each unique clan with their total points and ranked by their total points.

#### people table schema

-name
-points
-clan

You should then return a table that resembles below

#### select on

-rank
-clan
-total_points
-total_people

The query must rank each clan by their total_points, you must return each unqiue clan and if there is no clan name (i.e. it's an empty string) you must replace it with [no clan specified], you must sum the total_points for each clan and the total_people within that clan.
